# karma-browserify-demo
A sandbox demo for using Karma and browserify with mocha tests.

#### Running Tests

The commands provide a few karma flags for getting familiar. Run `karam start --help` to see them all. View [package.json](package.json) for the full list of commands (the `"scripts"` property).

```
npm install
npm test # run tests with PhantomJS and exit
npm tdd # listens for file changes and re-runs tests.
```

Recommend installing karma globally:

```
npm install -g karma
```
